## Instruction:

1. fork the course repository in github with this [url](https://github.com/alisharifi2000/CS-SBU-DataMining-MSc-2022)
![fork_repository](https://github.com/alisharifi2000/CS-SBU-DataMining-MSc-2022/blob/main/assets/images/fork_repository.png)

3. make a folder in submits folder with your student-id name for example CS-SBU-MachineLearning-BSc-2022/submits/95222046

you can upload this folder or make it in github.
![create folder](https://github.com/alisharifi2000/CS-SBU-DataMining-MSc-2022/blob/main/assets/images/create_folder.png)
![make folder](https://github.com/alisharifi2000/CS-SBU-DataMining-MSc-2022/blob/main/assets/images/make_folder.png)

5. make branch with your student-id name 
![create branch](https://github.com/alisharifi2000/CS-SBU-DataMining-MSc-2022/blob/main/assets/images/create_branch.png)

7. pull request for merging your branch to main branch.
